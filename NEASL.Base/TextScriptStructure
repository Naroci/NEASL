as a base structure, to differentiate between different objects given the same Name / Id
its important to have some sort of folder / naming structure to prevent them from colliding.

current thought is therefore to put "APP" as some sort of root folder and then for each Page 
its own subfolder ->

Either:
------------------------------------ 
    APP
        |-> MAIN.neasl                  //  ->  Main (App) Root / Index Info File.
        |-> /PAGE                       //  ->  Whatever Type of a Section (as name).
            |-> /PAGE1                  //  ->  Whatever given id-name of the Section
                |-> PAGE1.neasl         //  ->  Script file itself.
                |-> /BUTTON             //  ->  Whatever Type name of a component 
                    |-> BUTTON1.neasl   //  ->  Script file itself.
                    |-> BUTTON2.neasl   //  ->  Script file itself.
            |-> /PAGE2
                |-> PAGE2.neasl
                |-> /BUTTON
                    |-> BUTTON1.neasl
                    |-> BUTTON2.neasl
        |-> /
still considering.....
