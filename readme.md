| Feature              | Description                                                                                     | Implemented |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Variables**         | Allow storing and manipulating data, with simple data types like strings, integers, floats, and booleans. | [ ]         |
| **Control Structures**| Basic conditional and looping structures.                                                      | [ ]         |
| - If/Else             | Branching logic based on conditions.                                                           | [ ]         |
| - Loops               | For, while, and do-while loops for repeated execution.                                          | [ ]         |
| - Switch/Case         | Alternate form of branching based on value matching.                                            | [ ]         |
| **Functions**         | Reusable blocks of code that can take inputs (parameters) and optionally return a value.         | [ ]         |
| **Input/Output (I/O)**| Handling of standard input and output.                                                          | [ ]         |
| - Standard input      | Reading user input (e.g., `input()` in Python).                                                 | [ ]         |
| - Standard output     | Writing output to the console (e.g., `print()` in Python).                                      | [ ]         |
| **Operators**         | Support for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.                                      | [ ]         |
| - Arithmetic Operators| `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for mathematical operations.                                            | [ ]         |
| - Comparison Operators| `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for comparisons.                                               | [ ]         |
| - Logical Operators   | `&&`, `||`, `!` for logical expressions.                                                        | [ ]         |
| **String Manipulation**| Methods to concatenate, slice, or modify strings (e.g., `substring()`, `length`).              | [ ]         |
| **Arrays/Lists**      | Collections of data that can be iterated over or manipulated (e.g., arrays, lists, or tuples).   | [ ]         |
| **Error Handling**    | Structures for catching and handling errors or exceptions (e.g., `try/catch` or `try/except`).   | [ ]         |
| **Comments**          | Lines of code ignored by the interpreter, used to add explanations (`#`, `//`, `/* */`).         | [ ]         |
| **File Handling**     | Reading from and writing to files (e.g., `open()` in Python or `file` in bash).                 | [ ]         |
